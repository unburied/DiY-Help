The UPC code will include it’s own white box, so there’s no need to include one in the art (and having a white box in your art will actually make it harder for you to line up the code correctly, as you can’t zoom in during the placement stage, so there’s a good chance of ending up with offset corners).

Disc and Vinyl Manufacturing,What's the difference between disc replication vs. duplication?,484,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/209237318-What-s-the-difference-between-disc-replication-vs-duplication-,"  Depending on the size of your CD or DVD order there are two different ways your discs get made. 1) Replicated Discs The most common way to manufacture CDs is to replicate them. This involves a process where we mold each disc from melted polycarbonate (plastic) pellets. Before we replicate your disc we create a metal stamper that contains all the data (music or video) that goes on your disc. This stamper gets mounted in the disc molding machine, and when we inject the liquid polycarbonate into the mold, the disc that is replicated already includes your music (or video) content! Disc replication is a highly efficient process, with a disc with your content on it molded every 3 to 4 seconds. However, there is a significant amount of setup work required to make the stamper, and for that reason there is usually a minimum order required of 500 to 1,000 discs. Because Disc Makers specializes in small orders for independent artists, filmmakers, and business, we are (to our knowledge) the only US factory that will replicate discs. Replicated discs are preferred for larger quantities (quantities of 500 units and up).  After your discs are replicated we will print on the disc surface using either silkscreen or offset printing technology, depending on the type of artwork you have.  2) Duplicated Discs If you need less than 300 discs, we will duplicate them. Instead of molding a disc from polycarbonate pellets we start with a blank CD-R or DVD-R, and burn your content on it. We use automated duplicators that can burn multiple discs at once for a very fast and efficient process when you only need a few discs. We will also print on your discs using either an industrial inkjet printer, or using silkscreen printing.  Is there a quality difference between replication and duplication? Your order size determines whether Disc Makers replicates or duplicates your discs. In terms of the audio or video quality a consumer experiences, replicated discs are identical to duplicated discs. However, there is a very small possibility that if your discs are duplicated there might be some older generation disc players (including in cars) that experience errors when playing the duplicated disc. That is because disc duplication is a more recently developed process than disc replication, and some older CD and DVD players that pre-date the duplication specification may not be able to read all the content.  It is very infrequent that this happens. And to make sure your Disc Makers discs perform better than anyone else’s discs we use only the highest grade blank discs for all our disc duplication needs.  There is a clear difference between replicated and duplicated discs, but they each serve useful functions in bridging the gap between your content and fans.    Get Started with your DiscReplication or Duplication Order.  If you have further questions, please contact your Disc Makers product specialist at 1-800-468-9353."

A DVD-5 is a single layer DVD that holds up to 4.7GB of data (around 120-133 minutes of video depending on compression). DVD-9 is a dual layer single sided DVD that holds up to 8.5GB of data (around 240 minutes of video depending on compression). This DVD is comprised of a solid layer and a semi-transparent layer that allows for almost twice the data of a DVD-5 and is often used to retain a higher bitrate (quality) that may not be feasible on a DVD-5. A characteristic or side effect with a DVD-9 is a slight pause in playback that happens when the DVD player laser changes from one layer to the next. This is referred to as a “layer break.” It is desirable to try and disguise this layer break by placing it in an inconspicuous location if possible. DVD-10 is a 2-sided DVD that holds up to 9.4GBs of data (around 266 minutes of video depending on compression). Please note that the two-sided DVD-10 is somewhat rare, and there is no interactivity between the sides. So to view the information on the other side, the DVD must be removed from the player and turned over. Most times this is used when putting an NTSC and PAL video on the same disc.

Disc and Vinyl Manufacturing,Differences Between Printing On The Disc Face Vs. The Rest Of The Packaging,268,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033775813-Differences-Between-Printing-On-The-Disc-Face-Vs-The-Rest-Of-The-Packaging,"KEEP IT SIMPLE: While we can print full-color (CMYK) images on the disc, silkscreen printing works best with solid spot colors (no halftones/tints, no CMYK process inks). This is true of all silkscreen printing, whether on discs, t-shirts, posters, or any other surface material. While more simplistic in appearance than full-color, this provides the best print quality on the finished discs -- in this case less is more, without a doubt. TONAL RANGE FOR HALFTONES: The tonal range that we can hold while silkscreening the discs is 15-85%. Tones lighter than 15% may blow out to zero, and those darker than 85% may fill in completely.(This does not affect 0% or 100%, of course.) As a result, we do not recommend using images with very dark or very light details. IMAGE CONTENT: High-contrast images work best. We do not recommend using images with subtle details or changes in tone, as they will not be visible when silkscreened. SKIN TONES: We recommend against using photographs of people for your on-disc printing. Unfortunately skin tones (both light and dark) fall within a range of tone that is difficult to print consistently with silkscreening, and can often take on unwanted color casts or become significantly lighter or darker than expected. GRADIENTS / BLENDS: We strongly recommend against printing any gradients or blends on the disc, as they do not print well and often result in a blotchy or banded appearance. NEUTRAL TONES: CMYK colors that are grey or near-grey (tan, creme, etc.) will often take on a color cast when silkscreened. For important neutral colors we recommend using a spot ink."
Disc and Vinyl Manufacturing,Explaining the disc silkscreen printing process,861,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/209926087-Explaining-the-disc-silkscreen-printing-process,"Silkscreen printing is the process Disc Makers uses for printing album artwork on the surface of CDs and DVDs. Invented in ancient China, it is an effective way to print on irregular surfaces, such as t-shirts, coffee mugs, or compact discs. In the disc silkscreen process, film separations are made that represent each color in the design. The film is laid on a fabric mesh that is covered with a special emulsion and exposed to light. Where the light hits the emulsion, it becomes solid; where the film covers the mesh, the emulsion remains unchanged, and then is washed off. The screen is then placed on top of the surface to be printed, and ink is pushed through the mesh using a squeegee. The ink is dried, and the next color is applied. Fine details are easily lost in the disc silkscreen printing process because of the mesh that is used. Elements of a design that are too small may end up sitting on the mesh itself, rather than in a hole in the mesh, where ink can pass through. Unfortunately, this mesh interference is an inevitable consequence of the process. The first hurdle in printing on a CD or DVD is the surface of the disc itself. Unlike white paper, a disc has three distinctly different surfaces, and each one has its own issues. There are two solutions to the problem of printing on the changing surfaces of a compact disc. The first is to print a flood coat, usually a layer of white ink that covers the printable surface. This gives the disc a more consistent printing surface, closer to printing on paper. The second option is to make sure any halftones in your design don't cut into the mirror band or stacking ring. Put most simply, a halftone is an image (like a photograph) converted into small dots to fool your eye into seeing shades of gray (or tints of a color). Depending on the tones present in the image, the dots may vary in size. The dots start out very small in light areas, and grow in size as the shade gets darker. Eventually, the dots overlap, revealing only small amounts of the background. Usually, even the large dots are so small your eye can’t distinguish them as inStepsDivIDual dots, and they blur together into shades of gray. Back in the olden days, to create a halftone printers would place a screen in front of a photograph that was to be imaged onto film. The number of rows per inch in the mesh would determine the screen frequency, or linescreen, of the halftone. This is all done electronically now, but the principle is the same. Line screen, measured in LPI (lines per inch), determines the detail of a halftone. Lower line screens result in larger, coarser halftone dots, and an obvious loss of fine detail. Higher line screens give finer detail because the dots are smaller and closer together. Disc Makers' standard screen printing uses a line screen of 100 LPI. This line screen is best suited to spot-color printing, and CMYK process printing where fine detail is not a requirement. Disc Makers also offers deluxe 200 LPI silkscreen printing. This line screen is the highest available in the industry, and is best suited to CMYK process printing when reproducing full-color designs with very fine detail. We strongly advise against overlapping halftone screens when silkscreening in a non-CMYK, spot color environment because of the increased potential for a visible moiré pattern to appear on your finished discs. A moiré pattern can appear when two or more halftone screens interfere with each other, a pattern present in the design, or the silkscreen mesh itself. Rather than overlapping those spot color screens, we suggest that you set up your images so that a single halftone prints over a solid color. Tonal range refers to the percentage of dots in an area of a halftone image. Pure white has a zero dot, pure black a 100% dot. On the silkscreen press, the ideal tonal range for a continuous tone image is 15% to 85%. Halftone dots with less than a 15% tone will drop out, or not print. This is dot loss. On the other end of the spectrum, tonal values greater than 85% will fill in and become solid. This is called dot gain. Dot gain and loss is an inevitable limitation of the silkscreen process. A gradient (also known as a blend) is an area in an image where the tonal range changes gradually, creating a very smooth transition from one color or tint to another. Unfortunately, the smooth transition of halftone dots in a gradient area on film does not reproduce as precisely when the film image is transferred to the silkscreen mesh. This generally results in inconsistent ink coverage and sudden tonal shifts that cause banding. Although banding is most evident in gradient areas that span across a wide tonal range, the results of any gradient in the CD silkscreening process are unpredictable. We recommend you avoid using gradients when designing for the CD or DVD itself, and cannot guarantee the quality of any silkscreened gradient."

Disc Makers, the nation’s leading Blu-ray duplicator, provides answers to all of your Blu-ray disc and format questions and concerns. Q: How fast can I have my Blu-ray discs manufactured? A: BD turn times are about 10 - 12 business days from approval and include a check disc.  Q: What is Blu-ray? A: Blu-ray also known as Blu-ray disc (BD), is a next generation format developed to deliver High Definition video content and or large amounts of data.  Q: Where does the name Blu-ray come from? A: The name Blu-ray refers to the laser used to read the disc.  A BD uses a shorter wavelength blue laser as opposed to the red laser used for SD DVDs and CDs.  Q: How does it work? A: Larger capacity on Blu-ray discs is achieved through the use of a shorter wavelength laser as opposed the larger red laser used on SD DVDs. The blue laser allows BD to utilize  smaller pits and lands than are used on SD DVDs.  Pits and lands are the method by which information is stored on an optical disc. Because the pits and lands are smaller they can be placed closer together resulting in more information being stored on the same size disc. In conjunction with different optics and faster disc rotation, BD discs can store 5X more data than SD DVDs.  Q: Is a Blu-ray disc physically larger than a SD DVD? A: No. The physical size and shape of the disc are the same as a SD DVDs and CDs.   Q: How much information can be put on a BD?   A: A BD-25 is a single layer disc and can hold up to 25 GB (Gigabytes) of data or HD/SD video.  A BD-50 is a dual layer disc and can hold up to 50 GB of data or Video.  For a BD-25, this translates into approximately 4 hours of HD video or 11 hours of SD video.  Q: What are some of the features of Blu-ray?•  Increased disc capacity allowing for HD video.•  6x the resolution of DVD with 7.1 channels of uncompressed audio.•  New menu integration with increased interactivity and menu navigation    over top of playing video.•  Network/internet connectivity•  Improved disc coating with increased resistance to scratches and smudges.  Q: Will my SD DVDs play on a Blu-ray player? A: Currently there are no requirements in the specification for Backwards compatibility. Backwards compatibility will be a product dependent issue.  Refer to manufacturer and model specifications for more information.  Q: Will my BD play on my old DVD player? A: No.  Blu-ray discs will not play on SD DVD players.   Q: Will my BD be compatible with all Blu-ray players? A: Compatibility with Blu-ray players is not guaranteed. The format is still very new and, as when SD DVD was first introduced, there are bugs to be worked out. Some older players may need firmware upgrades and there is evidence of compatibility issues. As always, no DVD is 100% compatible so test your DVD early and often.  Q: How many region codes will Blu-ray have? A: Blu-ray will have 3 region codes A, B, and C.  They are as follows:  A - Americas; East and Southeast Asia. B - Africa, Europe, Oceania; Middle East; French territories; Greenland. C - Central and South Asia; Mongolia, Russia, and People's Republic of China  Q: What is the acceptable master delivery for Blu-ray Replication/Duplication? A: Blu-ray Replication: Masters for Blu-ray replication must be submitted in Cutting Master Format (BDCMF or Sony CMF) on removable USB 2.0 hard drives formatted for Windows OR files should be submitted in Cutting Master Format (BDCMF or Sony CMF) image on BD-R: Playable BD-Rs are not acceptable for Blu-ray replication.

Disc and Vinyl Manufacturing,Glossary of Vinyl Terminology,761,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010414148-Glossary-of-Vinyl-Terminology,"These are some common terms used in vinyl manufacturing, this may be a bit confusing if hearing these for the first time so contact us if you have any questions! Lacquers:  A blank lacquer is an aluminum disc that is coated with a nitrocellulose lacquer layer. A lacquer is the first step in the vinyl manufacturing process – grooves are cut into the face of the blank lacquer via a machine called a lathe.  While a lacquer can be played on a turntable, master lacquers that are going to be used for a real pressing job are never played – they are sent directly to an electroplating facility to be used as the substrate in the Electroforming process that makes the metal parts which are eventually used to press records.  Cut lacquers are sometimes called the Master. Lathe: A record lathe is a machine used to cut the grooves into the face of a blank lacquer.  This machine is not a record press – this is a machine designed to make single cuts of master recordings into blank lacquers, not to mass produce pressed records. Biscuit: The sandwich that is ultimately pressed into a record.  A biscuit consists of a hockey-puck shaped piece of extruded vinyl between a Label on the top and bottom.  The biscuit is compressed by the Record Press into the shape of a vinyl record. Electroforming: The forming (or growing) of a metal onto the face of a substrate.  This process is used in many industries where very accurate replicas of a substrate are a requirement.  A very similar process is used to create the Stamper for CD Replication! In record manufacturing, the substrate is the cut Lacquer.  The cut lacquer is cleaned and then sprayed with a silver solution.  This sprayed lacquer is then put into a bath of nickel sulfamate solution.  When an electric current is run through the bath, nickel atoms are drawn to the face of the silvered lacquer, and a nickel layer “grows” on the face.  When this nickel layer is removed from the lacquer, the removed layer becomes the father or stamper.  Fathers: A Father is the inverse of a cut lacquer – instead of playable grooves the face of the father consists of the inverse of grooves — peaks.  A father is used to create a Mother, and is then either stored for future use or, converted to a Stamper.  Fathers are sometimes called the Metal Master. Mothers: The metal plate that is two steps removed from a cut Lacquer — a mother has grooves on its face, and can be played on a turntable.  A mother is used to make Stampers. Stampers: The metal part that is affixed to a record press, which stamps grooves into melted vinyl Biscuits.  Stampers are the inverse of grooves — peaks instead of grooves. Innersleeve:  This the the paper sleeve that the record is directly inserted into.  Our pricing includes blank innersleeves by default. Blank innersleeves most commonly have a diecut hole on each side so the record Label can show through. Jackets: Also commonly referred to as a “cover” a jacket is the outer pocket that records are inserted into – records first go into an Innersleeve, and are then inserted into the record jacket. Label: The paper circle in the middle of a pressed record.  Sometimes referred to as a “sticker”, a record label is actually not adhered to the face of the disc after pressing – it is an integral part of the pressing process, and serves to cool the middle of the record while it is being pressed. Matrix Inscription / Matrix Number: Sometimes also referred to as a “scribe” or “scribe number”.  The alphanumeric identifier that is etched into the lead-out (matrix) area of the record. Usually, this number is arbitrary – it just has to be something that is somewhat unique.  The matrix inscription is important to both the plating dept and the pressing dept, because it is the only way of visually identifying lacquers and metal parts. Record Press:  A hydraulic press that compresses the vinyl Biscuit between two stampers and produces pressed records.  Pressed records are not made from blank discs. Test Pressings:  These are actual pressed records, but typically are the first time that records are being pressed from a set of Stampers.  They are made from the same material as production records, and have the same groove information.  They typically have labels which designate them as test pressings. They are the “final approval” mechanism before productions copies of a particular program are produced. "
Disc and Vinyl Manufacturing,Record speeds and allowable program times per side,135,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/208924288-Record-speeds-and-allowable-program-times-per-side,"Please note that the longer your vinyl program is (i.e. the more minutes per side) the lower the volume of your records will be. This is due to the fact that in order to fit more music on the record, the grooves need to be closer together and shallower. Recommended maximum program lengths: We recommend 45 RPM for 7” records. While 33 1/3 RPM are possible they are sometimes prone to distortion. As a rule it’s always better to come in a minute or two under the available time to ensure the best playback of the program. To achieve quality vinyl production we recommend using a mastering house with significant vinyl mastering experience to prepare your supplied masters.

Artwork and Design Templates,Tips for providing the best vinyl and cd packaging designs,490,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/209215308-Tips-for-providing-the-best-vinyl-and-cd-packaging-designs,"Keep it simple: While we can print full-color (CMYK) images on the disc, silkscreen printing works best with solid spot colors (no halftones/tints, no CMYK process inks). This is true of all silkscreen printing, whether on discs, t-shirts, posters, or any other surface material. While more simplistic in appearance than full-color, this provides the best print quality on the packaging design-- in this case less is more, without a doubt. Tonal range for halftones: The tonal range that we can hold while silkscreening the discs is 15-85%. Tones lighter than 15% may blow out to zero, and those darker than 85% may fill in completely.(This does not affect 0% or 100%, of course.) As a result, we do not recommend using images with very dark or very light details. Image content: High-contrast images work best. We do not recommend using images with subtle details or changes in tone, as they will not be visible when silkscreened. Skin tones: We recommend against using photographs of people for your on-disc printing. Unfortunately skin tones (both light and dark) fall within a range of tone that is difficult to print consistently with silkscreening, and can often take on unwanted color casts or become significantly lighter or darker than expected. Gradients / blends: We strongly recommend against printing any gradients or blends on the disc, as they do not print well and often result in a blotchy or banded appearance. Neutral tones: CMYK colors that are grey or near-grey (tan, creme, etc.) will often take on a color cast when silkscreened. For important neutral colors we recommend using a spot ink. Process color uses translucent CMYK inks laid on top of one another to fool your eye into seeing other colors. A spot color ink is a specially-mixed hue that is not made by combining two or more inks, but rather is a single ink of a specific color. Spot colors can be brighter or more saturated than process colors, or have special properties, such as metallic gold or fluorescent green. We have one price for any type of color printing on your discs; all you need to do is supply the art as you'd like it to look and our prepress specialists will determine which printing method will work best with your art and adjust it if necessary. Typically we will convert large areas of solid color to spot inks, as well as monochromatic, sepia and other images using a small range of hues. Artwork that utilizes the full spectrum of color, such as photographic images, will typically be printed as CMYK. Of course, if you know you want spot color printing go ahead and set your file up to use spot colors (up to six) and we'll print it that way. If you're not sure how, just ask us to take care of it! You can also get your vinyl or cd packaging design done by the Design Studio at Disc Makers."

Because of the inherent differences in printing methods, inks and surface materials, the end result can be significantly different even under the best of circumstances.  If you use the same image or similar colors on your disc as on your packaging they will probably not match; if an exact match is critical to your design we recommend altering your on-disc design to use contrasting or complimentary colors rather than identical colors or images so a color match is n/a."

Artwork and Design Templates,CMYK and RGB - Why we ask for CMYK files,420,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/209215058-CMYK-and-RGB-Why-we-ask-for-CMYK-files,"CMYK and RGB are two different color models, and understanding the difference can mean producing a great-looking insert rather than a muddy, disappointing one. We’ll have to delve into a little science to explain this difference. The RGB color model is used by monitors, televisions, scanners, and digital cameras. A monitor uses very small bands of red, green, and blue light to generate color. For a quick science project, put a drop of water on the front of your monitor in a white area, and it will act like a magnifying glass. You’ll be able to see the red, green, and blue bands. RGB is additive because when you add all three colors together, you get white light; when you turn off all three lights, you get black. By mixing varying amounts of red, green, and blue light, you can create most other colors. The paper of a magazine, catalog, or CD booklet can’t generate light like a computer monitor. It has to rely on reflected light, and the subtractive color model CMYK. When you add cyan, magenta, and yellow together (CMY), you get a color close to black, and when you don’t lay down any ink, you get white—that is, the white of the paper. A fourth color, black, is added for economical and practical reasons, and is referred to by ‘K’ so as not to be confused with blue. By mixing varying amounts of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks, you can create most other colors. All commercial, full-color printing uses CMYK inks. So why is the difference important? Most colors created on your RGB monitor can be duplicated using CMYK inks, but not all. Your RGB monitor is generating light, so it can create some bright colors that can’t be duplicated on any CMYK printing press. Paper can only reflect light, so if you print the super-bright RGB colors in CMYK, they get a lot duller. If you’re designing artwork in an RGB color space, we’ll have to convert it to CMYK to print. Depending on your artwork, the colors might shift a little or a lot.  Some colors in RGB can become much duller in CMYK.  We ask you to provide all your images in CMYK. If there are any color shifts, you’ll be able to see them and take steps to correct it. If you supply RGB images, we’ll make the CMYK conversion here. It’s much better for you to supply us with CMYK files up front. Learn how to convert RGB to CMYK. https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/209639867-Convert-RGB-to-CMYK"
Artwork and Design Templates,Why are low resolution and re-sampled or scaled images common template mistakes?,194,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/209628787-Why-are-low-resolution-and-re-sampled-or-scaled-images-common-template-mistakes-,"Re-sampling: Let's say you are working in Adobe Photoshop and you have a 72ppi image. If you re-sample that image by replacing ""72"" with ""300"" in the Photoshop's Image Size window, you would just re-sampling neighboring pixels to add more pixels per inch. It gives a slightly softer result, though does not drastically improve the appearance. The result will be generally blurry and pixelated depending on the degree of re-sampling. Scaling: You've started with an image that is 300ppi at 2 inches square and made the image bigger in your layout to fill the CD cover. Although the image was in fact 300ppi, when you enlarge it the resolution decreases. So, your image that was 300ppi at 2 inches is only going to be about 120ppi when scaled up to 4.75 inches. This can result in more jagged appearance depending on how large you scale the image. Increasing or decreasing your resolution in these ways can also change the ruler of the image and make it appear either much smaller or much larger than you intended.

Although part of the disparity is due to the quality of the individual make and model numbers, much of the difference is also due to variations in the manufacturer's factory calibration settings. You may like your monitor very bright, or the room you are viewing your files in may be dim. These factors and many more all affect your perception of color. In order to judge color consistency, we need to calibrate our monitors. There are many tools out there to aid with monitor calibration, but one that is affordable and very easy to use is the X-rite ColorMunki display. It will take readings of the ambient light in your room, as well as your monitor to adjust your settings to display as close to a printed sheet of paper as possible."

Artwork and Design Templates,What’s The Difference Between CMYK And RGB?,358,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034340233-What-s-The-Difference-Between-CMYK-And-RGB-,"CMYK and RGB are two different color models, and understanding the difference can mean producing a great-looking insert rather than a muddy, disappointing one. We’ll have to delve into a little science to explain this difference.The RGB color model is used by monitors, televisions, scanners, and digital cameras. A monitor uses very small bands of red, green, and blue light to generate color. For a quick science project, put a drop of water on the front of your monitor in a white area, and it will act like a magnifying glass. You’ll be able to see the red, green, and blue bands. RGB is additive because when you add all three colors together, you get white light; when you turn off all three lights, you get black. By mixing varying amounts of red, green, and blue light, you can create most other colors. The paper of a magazine, catalog, or CD booklet can’t generate light like a computer monitor. It has to rely on reflected light, and the subtractive color model CMYK. When you add cyan, magenta, and yellow together (CMY), you get a color close to black, and when you don’t lay down any ink, you get white—that is, the white of the paper. A fourth color, black, is added for economical and practical reasons, and is referred to by ‘K’ so as not to be confused with blue. By mixing varying amounts of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks, you can create most other colors. All commercial, full-color printing uses CMYK inks.So why is the difference important? Most colors created on your RGB monitor can be duplicated using CMYK inks, but not all. Your RGB monitor is generating light, so it can create some bright colors that can’t be duplicated on any CMYK printing press. Paper can only reflect light, so if you print the super-bright RGB colors in CMYK, they get a lot duller. If you’re designing artwork in an RGB color space, we’ll have to convert it to CMYK to print. Depending on your artwork, the colors might shift a little or a lot.  Some colors in RGB can become much duller in CMYK."

Our print shop trims printed pieces in stacks of hundreds of sheets at a time. This is much faster than trimming individual pieces, at the cost of a little accuracy.

If you re-sample that image by replacing ""72"" with ""300"" in the Photoshop's Image Size window, you would just re-sampling neighboring pixels to add more pixels per inch. It gives a slightly softer result, though does not drastically improve the appearance. The result will be generally blurry and pixelated depending on the degree of re-sampling.Scaling: In Photoshop this can be found under image and image size, the document size is the place you should be focused on. You've started with an image that is 300dpi at 2 inches square and made the image bigger in your layout to fill the CD cover. Although the image was in fact 300dpi, when you enlarge it the resolution decreases. So, your image that was 300dpi at 2 inches is only going to be about 120dpi when scaled up to 4.75 inches. This can result in more jagged appearance depending on how large you scale the image."

Artwork and Design Templates,Rich Black vs Black,181,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019106994-Rich-Black-vs-Black,"Rich black is when under color (cyan, magenta and yellow) are added to black to make a color that is darker then the black ink by itself. There are different reasons for wanting a rich black. One is to create a color bridge between different colored elements. This could be a way of trapping colors. Another is to get a very dark color for the black. Too much ink will cause the print to get muddy and can cause offsetting where the ink doesn't dry completely and sticks to the sheet above it. We use an ink limit of 300 total ink for our offset print work. For a rich black, you really don't want to get that close to the ink limit. If you are trying to create a color bridge we suggest using 40C-30M-30Y-100K. At it's darkest, this will give you at least a 30% bridge and will not run the risk of offsetting. If you are just looking for a deeper black we suggest 40C-0M-0Y-100K. This will give a deep black color without running a risk of offsetting."

Artwork and Design Templates,Tips For Providing The Best Vinyl And Cd Packaging Designs,487,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035093133-Tips-For-Providing-The-Best-Vinyl-And-Cd-Packaging-Designs,"Keep it simple: While we can print full-color (CMYK) images on the disc, silkscreen printing works best with solid spot colors (no halftones/tints, no CMYK process inks). This is true of all silkscreen printing, whether on discs, t-shirts, posters, or any other surface material. While more simplistic in appearance than full-color, this provides the best print quality on the packaging design-- in this case less is more, without a doubt. Tonal range for halftones: The tonal range that we can hold while silkscreening the discs is 15-85%. Tones lighter than 15% may blow out to zero, and those darker than 85% may fill in completely.(This does not affect 0% or 100%, of course.) As a result, we do not recommend using images with very dark or very light details. Image content: High-contrast images work best. We do not recommend using images with subtle details or changes in tone, as they will not be visible when silkscreened. Skin tones: We recommend against using photographs of people for your on-disc printing. Unfortunately skin tones (both light and dark) fall within a range of tone that is difficult to print consistently with silkscreening, and can often take on unwanted color casts or become significantly lighter or darker than expected. Gradients / blends: We strongly recommend against printing any gradients or blends on the disc, as they do not print well and often result in a blotchy or banded appearance. Neutral tones: CMYK colors that are grey or near-grey (tan, creme, etc.) will often take on a color cast when silkscreened. For important neutral colors we recommend using a spot ink. Process color uses translucent CMYK inks laid on top of one another to fool your eye into seeing other colors. A spot color ink is a specially-mixed hue that is not made by combining two or more inks, but rather is a single ink of a specific color. Spot colors can be brighter or more saturated than process colors, or have special properties, such as metallic gold or fluorescent green. We have one price for any type of color printing on your discs; all you need to do is supply the art as you'd like it to look and our prepress specialists will determine which printing method will work best with your art and adjust it if necessary. Typically we will convert large areas of solid color to spot inks, as well as monochromatic, sepia and other images using a small range of hues. Artwork that utilizes the full spectrum of color, such as photographic images, will typically be printed as CMYK. Of course, if you know you want spot color printing go ahead and set your file up to use spot colors (up to six) and we'll print it that way. If you're not sure how, just ask us to take care of it! You can also get your vinyl or CD packaging design done by our art team!"

To do this we go through rigorous certification and calibration to conform to commercial printing standards. A device called a densitometer is used to measure the ink density of the printed sample. This is measured against the PDF your book was printed from. The difference between the two is expressed as the ""Delta E"" value. In order to speak on the same terms for color evaluation, you can reference this chart This is a way to speak about color based on empirical data, rather than perception of the human eye. The readings are based on reproduction on gloss stock. Factors such as image resolution and the paper stock used will affect the Delta E. We strive to be at a Delta of 5 or better, but in many cases up to an 8 would be deemed an acceptable commercial standard."

Our booklet templates are arranged in either Reader's spreads or Printer’s spreads. Readers Spreads: Our templates default to this version.  Readers Spreads align the pages in order of pagination which means the pages are in numerical order. If your project displays the incorrect version in your proof, you may need to have your quote adjusted. Give us a call and we can set that up for you.  Printers Spreads: This version of the template is available upon request. Each page of the document has 2 booklet pages side by side. The pages are not in numerical order (printers spreads). The pages are numbered so that when printed, trimmed and bound they will be in the correct order. The page numbers are marked in the templates and should not be rearranged.   If you're preparing one of our multi-page templates (such as a booklet), the ideal applicationto do so is a fully featured layout application (such as InDesign, Illustrator, or CorelDraw). We do supply a PDF (which shows a 2 panel spread) - which can be opened in Photoshop, but as Photoshop does not support multipage layouts, you'll need to build each spread, two pages at a time.We have templates created for the layout applications mentioned that are properly paginatedfor you already (in printer spreads).

Artwork and Design Templates,How to read your proofs,200,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/213963057-How-to-read-your-proofs,"When looking at your proofs, take notice of the markings that we use in our templates. These show how the piece will be cut in the print shop.  Bleed is extending any color, photo, or design elements past the cut line. Bleed gives the print shop a margin of error when trimming, so that if the cut is a little off, the white of the paper won’t show along the edge. Crop Marks show the print shop where to trim the pieces. Safety Margins shows the outermost edge of where we can place important elements. If you put important information such as a song title or an important part of a photo right up against the crop line, some of it may get cut off. For that reason, we keep type and other important elements within the safety, 1/8” inside the crop marks. Your disc proof will show the disc as it will be printed. (There is a masked layer over the top of your artwork to provide a more accurate print image. For full color discs, there is approximately 2mm of the silver disc showing around the outer edge. For glossy disc print, the entire surface will be covered). "
Artwork and Design Templates,Color Modes - CMYK vs RGB,171,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/213440338-Color-Modes-CMYK-vs-RGB,"The color mode used to create color on a computer monitor is completely different than the color mode used to print color on a press. Check out the samples and explanations below, and then trust that we’ve got your colors well under control! RGB (Red, Green, Blue)The RGB color mode, used by computer monitors, is made by combining three luminous, or glowing colors. The RGB color mode is capable of producing many more colors on screen than the Process (CMYK) color mode. This can pose a problem because many of the bright RGB images you may see on your computer simply can’t be reproduced on a press. When we receive RGB images, we convert them to CMYK for our use. Please be aware that color shifts may occur. CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) CMYK is the color mode that is used for all of our print graphics. When screens of the four CMYK “process” colors are combined in a dot pattern on paper, the human eye merges them into one color."
Artwork and Design Templates,Image Resolution,125,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/213962977-Image-Resolution,"High-quality design demands high-resolution images. It’s as simple as that. Look at the examples below and check out our get started page for more information on supplying your images.  High-resolution images should be 300 ppi (pixels per inch) for greyscale and CMYK images, 1200 ppi for line art. Low-resolution images include 72 ppi graphics captured from the internet, or images taken on cameras not set to highestquality or often images taken on cell phones. They will look fuzzy and pixelated. NOTE: Enlarging small images reduces overall print quality. **Note:  Saving or submitting an image at a higher resolution than 300-350ppi will not produce a better printed piece. It will increase the image size making it more difficult to print the essential elements of the design."

Simply choose the ""Audio CD"" option when uploading your content; Our step-by-step software will help you do the rest. You must download and complete a Track Listing Form to include with your audio master for disc replication. Required information on the form includes a complete and accurate running time log listing all events (tones, silences, songs, outtakes, noises, etc.) as they occur.The maximum length for CDs is 79:45 minutes. For programs over the industry recommended 78:00 total time, you must submit a signed disclaimer form with your order.

Additional technical information: Digital Audio Tape (DAT) • Digital Audio Tape: 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz sampling rate • Pre-roll: 10-15 seconds recorded silence. (Optional) Calibration tone: 1 kHz at -12 dB (never at 0 dB). • Start IDs: sequentially numbered, placed at the start of each selection, one number per song.• A sampling rate of 44.1 kHz is highly recommended.• Your dB meters should peak no higher than 0, with no over levels, and must average above -15 dB (Red Book minimum standard).• Be sure your DAT and box are labeled. 1/2"" or 1/4"" Analog Tape • 30 ips, 15 ips, or 7 1/2 ips.• Alignment (test) tones at head: 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and 100 kHz at 0 dB operating level.• Indicate type of noise reduction, if any, and include proper tones.• Leader tape at head and tail of tape (15 seconds minimum) and two to four seconds in between songs.• Tape slow-wound, tails out, in properly labeled box. Handling mastersHandle all masters carefully, both before and after recording. Touch CD masters only by the edges and keep them free of fingerprints and scratches that can cause data errors. Make sure your master and box are labeled clearly with your contact information. DVD MastersBefore sending in your master, test it thoroughly to make sure that it performs exactly the way you want it to. Your finished discs will be an identical copy of your master. DVD+R or DVD-R are acceptable for replication of DVD-5 and DVD-10 discs, and can be produced on either an authoring or general drive. For DVD-9, you must supply two DLT masters (layer 0 and layer 1) or DDPs on DVD-Rs. DVD+R DL can also be used for DVD-9s. DLTs and DDPs on disc are also acceptable for DVD-5 and DVD-10. Any project requiring CSS or Macrovision copy protection must be authored as such and must be submitted on DLT or DDP on disc. All DLT masters must include DDP files. Always use high-quality recordable (DVD-R or DVD+R) non-rewritable discs for your DVD masters. DVD-ReWritable (DVD-RW) discs should not be used for making DVD masters. Not all DVD readers can read DVD-RW discs. This can lead to problems during replication.Need help preparing your DVD master? Click here for information about our authoring services.

These formats are all ""lossy"", meaning they discard some portion of the audio information in order to create files that are smaller in size and require less storage space. While this is acceptable to many people as a final distribution format that listeners can store on an MP3 player, you probably want your CDs duplicated from a high quality, 16-bit/44.1K file format such as WAV. Before ripping your CD, check the Import Settings by selecting Edit > Preferences > Import Settings (on the General tab). Make sure ""Import Using"" is set to WAV Encoder. You can also click the ""Import Settings"" button at the bottom of the screen that comes up when you insert an audio CD into your drive.

As a part of the down conversion process, the video resolution is reduced to accommodate the SD format. By specification SD video is a lower resolution and will result in quality loss. How much quality loss will depend on original shooting format, CODEC, and the software or hardware used to down convert the video.

Computer drives operate the same as DVD/Blu-ray players except the region code may not be pre set. The code must be set by the owner and may have a limited number of changes allowed. Region codes exist for the benefit of the owner or distributor of a DVD/Blu-ray title, and they protect the rights of a distributor in one region from encroachment by a distributor from another region. The region code is an entirely separate issue from the NTSC/PAL video standard which can also affect playback. As a final note on the subject, it is important to remember that region codes can only be set during the authoring process, not during manufacturing. Be sure to consult your author prior to completion of your master. Below is a chart outlining the 8 region codes defined in the DVD specification and the 3 for Blu-ray.  *NOTE: the video standard (PAL/NTSC) can also restrict playback."

The amount of correction or enhancement possible will be greatly affected by the quality of the original video. As always, great care should be exercised with lighting and audio when making the original recording. The quality of the camera and lens used will greatly affect the final quality. An uncompressed or 2k image or larger will allow for better “enhancement” results than a mp4 or other “compressed” image. Even though most cameras claim they are HD, the vast differences in CODECs, lenses, and sensors can vary greatly in the final quality.

Follow this link- https://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp and if you get a notification that you need to update Java, follow the instructions to do so.  Once Java is installed, you need to give it permission to run (Java is blocked by default in most browsers). These instructions all use Firefox in the examples.   Find the ""Java Applet"" plugin, and set it to either ""Always Activate"" or ""Ask to Activate"" (obviously, ""Never Activate"" would be the incorrect option).  The uploader page will load up, and you may very likely see a warning come up in your browser asking if you're sure you want to run the Java application.  You do, so select ""Allow"". You'll also see a popup that looks like this:  Select ""Run"" and check off the box so you're not asked again on future visits.

The SoundLAB is certified by Apple to provide this service. Only masters from certified mastering facilities can be submitted to Apple as a Digital Master. In order to be Apple certified the client must provide a high resolution master to us for the mastering session. The master must be at least 24-bits, with a sample rate of at least 44.1K, though higher is recommended if possible. If a 16-bit master such as an audio CD, upload through our MUA, or 16-bit WAV files is submitted, we cannot complete the Apple Digital Masters process. The second part of the Apple Digital Master process happens during the mastering session. Using tools provided by Apple, the mastering engineer will preview the mastered files through the same encoding process that Apple will use to create the AAC files that will be sold through iTunes. Based on that preview the engineer may make some adjustments to the mastered files in order to optimize the sound after the encoding process is completed. Another tool alerts the engineer to any clipping of the audio signal that is occuring during the AAC conversion. Based on this info the engineer can reduce the overall volume to avoid this clipping. The result of this process is a file submitted to Apple that will yield the highest quality conversion to an AAC file for sale on iTunes. Since the Apple Digital Mastering process process does add time to a mastering session there will be an additional charge of $10 per track when a client is requesting this service. In order to request this service, please call us at 1-888-296-2747 to get a custom quote. To submit Apple Digital Master files to iTunes you will need to do a second submission through CD Baby.

Final Product Concerns,You're shipping more / less of the total number of discs that I ordered. Why?,136,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042244434-You-re-shipping-more-less-of-the-total-number-of-discs-that-I-ordered-Why-,"You may notice that your order quantity is more or less than you ordered. We try to deliver as close to the exact number of units ordered as possible, but it's important that you allow for as much as 5% over or under that number. The reason for overruns and underruns is this: all CD plants manufacture a bit more than you order, then discard any copies that don't meet quality standards. If there are more discards than we expect, you'll receive fewer copies than you ordered and we'll refund for the ones that we don't ship; if there aren't many discards, you'll receive somewhat more. You will only be charged for the exact number of CDs or DVDs you receive. Don't want to pay for overs? Simply prepay your order in full and they're free!"

It can hold about 120 minutes worth of video programming for a single layer disc and 240 minutes for a dual layer disc. (These times are bases on using typical video compression, certain video authoring programs can compress the video and fit even more onto a single discs, but this would sacrifice the video quality) 4.7 GB - Single Layer DVD8.5 GB - Dual Layer DVD You will need a special program to author your video into the proper DVD Video standard format. You can read more about DVD authoring here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_authoring A DVD-ROM can also hold virtually any type of DATA you would like. A DVD can hold up to 4.7GBs on a single layer disc and 8.5 GBs on a dual layer disc. This DATA could be PDFs, MP3s, Microsoft Word Documents, Quicktime Movies, pretty much anything as long as you do not exceed the size limit. KEEP IN MIND: Unlike your typical VIDEO DVD (which should be playable by anyone that has a set top DVD Player) the end recipient must have the program capable of opening the data on the DVD-ROM. Simply putting your digital video files onto a DVD without authoring the disc to the proper format will result in inconsistent playback across different devices.

They have an inky brown burning surface and  the color lightens after being burned. LTH or Low to High discs are a golden color and darken with burning. For both formats the burned information looks the same to the player, so all players can play either format. Some older burners (older than 2011) will only be able to use the standard (HTL) discs unless they are updated with new firmware."
Hardware Product Support,How can I get the best results from my duplicator?,245,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/208924218-How-can-I-get-the-best-results-from-my-duplicator-,"Here are a few helpful hints for making the most of your duplicator. Control your disc burning speed:The highest speed setting is not always the best. For example: Audio CDs lack error correction, therefore, even for CD-Rs that support burn speeds of up to 52x, the optimal burning speed is 16x. Duplicate from the hard drive image:On multi-drive disc duplicator units the optimal method for duplication is to load your master image on to the hard drive and then burn, rather than burning disc-to-disc. You’ll not only get consistently faster burn speeds, but you’ll also get fewer rejects. Protect your master discs:Keep masters clean. Master discs should be stored in protective packaging and free from scratches, fingerprints, and debris. A poor master will produce a poor copy. Keep your duplicator clean:Keep your unit in a clean, temperature controlled environment and on a firm level surface. Extreme temperatures and dusty environments can cause bad duplicates and even damage your unit. Always use high-quality media:The number one factor that determines your reject rate is the quality of the media you use. While you may save a few pennies by buying economy-brand media, you’ll pay for it in time and money over the long run due to an increased reject rate. Disc Makers tests our Premium and Ultra (our top recommendation) media to ensure the fastest duplication speeds and lowest rejection rates possible when used in conjunction with our duplicator units.

Hardware Product Support,How can I buy something that gets me an end product exactly like Disc Makers offers?,176,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/208924088-How-can-I-buy-something-that-gets-me-an-end-product-exactly-like-Disc-Makers-offers-,"Disc Makers sells DUPLICATION equipment, larger orders of discs placed through Disc Makers are REPLICATED or Pressed. The replication machinery, like that used in our CD & DVD plants, is extremely technical and requires specialized expertise to operate. Our duplication equipment allows short-runs of printed discs to be produced with professional quality very quickly. You can efficiently produce as few as one disc per master. This contrasts with DVD and CD replication, which is the process used for large runs of CDs or DVDs. The duplication process produces CD-Rs or DVD-Rs, which are discs that are encoded using laser-based burners. Replication, on the other hand, stamps out CDs or DVDs using physical molds (called glass masters). Replication typically has a 300 unit per master minimum, requires manual set-up of glass masters and silk-screens with associated fees, and typically takes 1-2 weeks to complete. DVD and CD replication may be more economical than duplication when you have at least a week and when more than 1000 units are required. View our Duplication Equipment See Our Replication Options"

If you decide you need a different product, we will give you full credit toward any other product we carry (but only during the first 30 days!). To use the PFG, call us at 1-888-800-4038. Got a problem? We carefully check every duplicator before it leaves our factory. If you suspect that there is something wrong with your system, don’t hesitate to call Disc Makers tech support at 1-888-800-4038. If something got damaged in shipping or is defective, we can swap your unit out for another (same model) during the first 30 days of ownership. After that, you’ll have to send it in for warranty service. If you decide for whatever reason you just want to return the equipment (within the first 30 days of purchase) and not get a different product, there is a 15% restocking fee. We asses this fee because we can no longer sell the equipment as new, and will have to test, refurbish, and repackage it. Return Material Authorizations (RMA): If you decide to return a unit, you must obtain an RMA number from our Customer Support Center. Please mark the RMA number clearly on the box(es) you are shipping back. The RMA number helps speed up the processing of your return and is standard in industries where products are returned/exchanged. Shipments received without an RMA# clearly marked on the package will be refused. Keep all of your original packaging (boxes/foam) in a safe place for the life of the unit. If you ever need to send a unit in for evaluation or repair, you will have the packaging available. We require you to ship equipment back in its original packaging. Failure to keep original packaging can result in extra costs (to buy new packaging) and a longer repair turnaround (you will have to wait for the new packaging to arrive before sending a unit in for repair). Any product returned to Disc Makers in non-original packaging will void the warranty. You are responsible for all shipping charges: Exceptions are when Disc Makers is exchanging equipment that we determined to be problematic out of the box, products covered by Advanced Replacement Service and products that we return to the customer after Warranty Service. Note: Always use a traceable method to send back equipment and insure for full value. Disc Makers cannot accept any opened software package for credit or refund. After 30 days, you’re still protected. Warranty: Most Disc Makers products include a one-year warranty that covers most parts and labor. If you have a problem with your unit while it’s under warranty we will repair it at our cost (except for shipping), except in cases of use for which the product is not intended or abuse on your end. Disc Makers provides a depot warranty, which means that you need to ship your unit to us with an RMA number and we will repair or replace it at our discretion. Extended Warranty: Some products can be purchased with an optional extended warranty. This adds an additional year to the standard warranty, so your equipment has warranty coverage for a total or two years from date of purchase. If you decide that you want to add an extra year of warranty, please call your hardware product specialist at 1-800-468-9353. Advanced Replacement Service (ARS): This optional yearly service plan is ideal for customers who cannot afford to be without their equipment while it is being serviced. Under this program Disc Makers will have you up and running within 2 business days. We’ll cover the expedited shipping both ways should a replacement unit be required. ARS must be purchased within the first 30 days of your unit purchase. For more information, contact your hardware product specialist at 1-800-468-9353. Technical Support: Telephone or email is free for as long as your product is in warranty. Out of warranty: Once your product is out of warranty, there will be a nominal fee for telephone, or live chat support of $25 per incident. An incident can include multiple contacts until the problem is resolved or there is an agreement that repair is needed. This fee is subject to change without notice. In case of an out of warranty repair, a Disc Makers customer support specialist will quote you an estimated fee for any repair work necessary prior to the repair being done. *The above information pertains to new Disc Makers Hardware purchases only; please see https://www.discmakers.com for specific information regarding Disc Makers Outlet and On-Line auction purchases."

It works like a photocopier - you supply it with an original (your master) and it outputs copies at high speed. A disc publishing system encompasses more. It connects to your computer and incorporates a printer as well as one or more drives to burn your CD-R or DVD-R media. Publishing systems are designed to output finished discs from files on a hard drive or network.

Silkscreen printing is generally regarded as the highest quality method of label printing. Replicated discs are printed using the silkscreen method, which can be set up for Spot (PMS) colors, Full-Color CMYK Process, or Offset. All of these methods are available on Disc Makers replicated discs, and all but Offset are available on Disc Makers silkscreened blank CD-R and DVD-R discs. **Silk screen printing onto a disc is typically not available to the end user when making discs at your location. You can always order professionally screen printed discs from us! Thermal printing is a durable, professional label at a rock-bottom per-disc cost of only 4¢ per disc. While the resolution of thermal printing doesn’t offer the same level of detail as other methods, it is an excellent choice for text and line art on silver or white discs. Thermal printing also requires no dry time, and thermally printed images will not smear or peel off. View Our Thermal Disc PrintersView Thermal Printable CD-RsView Thermal Printable DVD-Rs Inkjet printing is a great way to get high resolution and great color without investing a lot in equipment. This method of printing requires the use of inkjet-compatible blank media (available from Disc Makers). Because ink is being applied to a less absorbent surface than paper, inkjet-printed discs require time to dry, and can smear if exposed to excessive moisture. However, Disc Makers Hydroshield media greatly shortens drying time and lessens the impact of moisture on your finished discs. View our Inkjet disc printersView our Inkjet printable CD-RsView our Inkjet printable DVD-Rs Paper Labels are still a favorite for user-friendly application and low cost.

Hardware Product Support,How do I choose a CD DVD duplication system?,245,https://support.discmakers.com/hc/en-us/articles/209630597-How-do-I-choose-a-CD-DVD-duplication-system-,"The right system is the one that works best with your work flow and volume needs. If you are already outputting CDs and just need to speed production, a standalone duplicator can be a great fit. You simply output one CD on your current system, and then use that CD as a master for duplication. Disc Makers Reflex tower duplicators are an easy-to-use, cost-efficient means to high-output disc duplication. Everyone understands that discs-per-hour equals speed. However, the fastest duplicator is not always the best fit. The key point to remember is that unless you already have silk-screened CD-R or DVD-R blanks, you’ll need to print your discs and duplicate them. For instance, let’s say that you plan to distribute 250 finished CDs to clients each month, and that each month’s CD artwork and CD content will be different. If you know that you’ll have the disc artwork and master ready with plenty of time to spare, one of our hands-free Automated Disc Publishing systems like the Primera 4200 series would be most efficient. However, if you know that you’ll be getting the master just a few days or even hours before the event - you’ll want to print the discs in advance and then use something from the Reflex series (like the popular Reflex7) to burn content onto your pre-printed discs in short order.
